# Tensorflow / Sentiment Analysis and Image Learning

## What you built? 
Built the following models from the tensor flow tutorials:
1) (Simple MNIST handwriting prediction)[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m2TUPdRvmR85YcsvaCZOuOgI6Rd8b_cO?usp=sharing]
2) (MNIST article of clothing identifier)[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IorVmVCfure8R3BshTu5tdf5sOSpM3ol?usp=sharing]
3) (Sentiment analysis of movie reviews)[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NaCqGPWtWPivjZMpbcXYQOOaY5xk9BHD?usp=sharing]

## Who Did What?
I worked on my own.

## What you learned
- learned about general ML practices, like building processing layers, splitting/cleaning the data, and compiling models
- learned and implemented the keras API
